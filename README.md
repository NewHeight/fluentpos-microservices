## Docker
 Generate Development certificate by running the following:

 ```
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\dev_cert.pfx -p password!
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
 ```

 Once the certificates are installed, navigate to `deployments/docker-compose` and run `docker compose up`.
